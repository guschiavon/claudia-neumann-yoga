<p class="editable">
 	Yin is slow and passive. It is steady and reflective. It is the energy with which we approach our Yin Yoga practice. Our aim is to target the deeper more yin tissues within the body, the connective tissues, ligaments, tendons and joints. We do this through long, still holds of varying asanas that target different parts of the physical and energetic body. The body and mind are challenged in a multitude of ways helping us to not only reap the physiological and anatomical benefits but also to cultivate more mindfulness and mental health benefits both on and off the mat.
