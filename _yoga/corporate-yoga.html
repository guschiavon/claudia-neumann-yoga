  <p>This class is suited to all levels, from beginners to advanced yogis and
  yoginis. We combine pranayama (breathing) practices with meditation and flow
  through the asana (yoga poses) with ease. We mainly work on those areas that
  suffer the most while sitting in an office such as back, hips, shoulders and
  neck.</p>

  <p>People who work in an office and are looking for a balance between their
  stressful day to day tasks and finding a connection with ourselves</p>
