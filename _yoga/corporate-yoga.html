  <p>This class is suited to all levels, from beginners to advanced yogis and
  yoginis. We combine pranayama (breathing) practices with meditation and flow
  through the asana (yoga poses) with ease. We mainly work on those areas that
  suffer the most while sitting in an office such as back, hips, shoulders and
  neck.</p>

  <p>Adding a weekly yoga class to your office routine, supports your employees'
  wellbeing and increases productivity. Yoga releases tension in the neck, back
  and shoulder area. Meditation increases concentration and focus.&nbsp; Simply
  because healthy employees make a healthy company!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="editable">
 	Through the continuity of a weekly class, I get to know your employees, offering adjustments and customized classes to fit to their specific needs. Special classes&nbsp; include jaw/tension relief, hand/ wrist care, and how to maintain good posture &ndash; counteracting the problems of the modern work life. My teaching method has prevented many cases of burn out!<br /><br />I know that everyone comes with a different story and has different body limits. I'm able to juggle different people&rsquo;s needs so that everyone feels simultaneously challenged and safe. Every class ends with relaxation and visualization techniques that help to significantly reduce stress in the workplace. I try to bring my students to a space where there is &ldquo;alertness without tension, relaxation without dullness&rdquo;, increasing both a sense of wellbeing and productivity.<br /><br />Benefits include:<br />* increases energy, clarity and focus<br />* reduces stress and illness<br />* improves overall efficiency and productivity<br />* reduces anxiety and irritability<br />* improves morale and team-spirit<br />* increases core strength, for better posture and more concentration.
