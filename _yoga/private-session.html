 	Why take your yoga beyond the studio?<br />It is common for new students to join a group yoga class and feel overwhelmed or out of place. In studio classes, instructors are simply not able to address the unique needs of every student.<br />Perfect choice for beginners to yoga!<br />Beginners to yoga require clear explanations and patient instruction to effectively learn the basics. Students with injuries must also learn safe alignment techniques and proper modifications. I can provide hands-on assists and individualized adjustments to ensure proper and safe alignment.<br />But also for advanced yogis and yoginis!<br />There&rsquo;s mainly two reasons a private class could serve your needs: Time and Personal Development. Your lifestyle might have changed (e.g. a new job or a baby) and you miss your yoga classes because you don&rsquo;t know how to fit them into your schedule? Your private lessons will be scheduled at a time and location that is most convenient for you. No more stressing about getting to class on time! The other reason might be that you&rsquo;re coming to your edge at studio classes and you&rsquo;d like to master some poses like headstand, deep diver into meditation or work on personal development then a private yoga class is perfect for you!
