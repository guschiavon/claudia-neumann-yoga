<p class="editable">
 	Reiki is an ancient healing therapy which was developed by Mikao Usui in Japan in the 1920s. It is a relaxing form of an energy healing treatment that is applied through noninvasive, nonmanipulative gentle touch. Not a system of religious beliefs, Reiki is simply a relaxing treatment whereas natural healing vibrations are transmitted through the hands of a Reiki practitioner (acting as a conduit) to the body of the recipient.&nbsp;<br /><br />A Reiki treatment involves the placing of the hands on the body in a passive way. Please note that Reiki is not a form of massage as the hands remain still and Reiki can be given through clothing. During a treatment most people experience a gentle warmth or tingling coming from the practitioner&rsquo;s hands.<br /><br />Reiki is not an alternative to allopathic medicine &mdash; it is a &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; therapy that can be implemented alongside all other medical and therapeutic techniques. It is a gentle technique that is suitable for even very fragile patients, so it is accepted widely in hospitals and hospices around the world. The profound relaxation produced by Reiki has been anecdotally reported to alleviate anxiety and stress, the perception of pain, and to promote a feeling of overall well-being.
