I",<p>In our society most people get up and first thing in the morning drink a coffee, have a cigeratte and rush to work. Is this the way you’d like to start to your day? Or is it something you just got used to? However, isn’t the start of the day how all of your day envolves?</p>

<p>I discovered an ayurvedic routine that gives me a fresh start to the day. When I wake up I keep lying in bed for another 5-10 minutes (on weekends a bit longer) to slowly wake up and open my eyes. Then I srape my tongue, to get rid of all the toxins that my body reliefed over night, and brush my teeth. Now it’s time for a fresh glass of water. To get the body moving I have a quick yogic self practise or if there is time a longer session, however, if you’re not into yoga, you might wanna simply stretch a little.</p>
