  <p>The sahara dessert is with over 9 million square kilometres the largest
  dessert in the world. It is like half of the USA or 26 times as big as
  Germany. In this retreat we are going to explore only a small area, the
  Marroccan part near Mhamid. The landscape is stunning, endless sand and regs,
  palm trees, valleys and mountains. In a dessert it is usually quite hot during
  the day and temperatures drop during the night. This is why we have our yoga
  classes early in the morning and in the evening. The people who live here are
  accommodating and friendly, 60% work as oasis farmers, everybody else lives a
  nomadic lifestyle which we are going to learn more about from Ali, our local
  guide, and his cameleers.</p>

Starting our day with a wake up yoga class followed by a healthy vegetarian breakfast we then walk with the rhythm of the camels and our cameleers 3 to 4 hours daily to our next destination. You also have the option to ride on the camels if your legs get tired.
