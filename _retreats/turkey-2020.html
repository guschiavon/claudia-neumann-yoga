 	A sailing trip along the Turkish coastline is an unforgettable travel experience. Your vivid encounter with the elements of nature, your daily yoga sessions, the benefits of a vegetarian, fresh and healthy Mediterranean cuisine, together with the option of an energy spending massage, or a snorkeling tour, all will combine to bring your spirit and body in balance. Most rapidly you will have forgotten about the everyday stress that you might experience in your professional life.The day starts with a sun salutation, or a smooth awakening yoga practice, in the pleasant light of the first sunbeams, as the sun climbs over the horizon of a deep blue sea.<br /><br />A choice of excursions on land will give you plenty of opportunities to get to know the nature, the culture and the history of this region. Exquisite jaunts to historical, archeological sites, herb hiking tours, or a visit to a nomadic village or a traditional&nbsp;<strong>Turkish bath</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; a hammam. They all share enriching insights into the wealth of the eastern Mediterranean culture.
