  <p>A sailing trip along the Turkish coastline is an unforgettable travel
  experience. Your vivid encounter with the elements of nature, your daily yoga
  sessions, the benefits of a vegetarian, fresh and healthy Mediterranean
  cuisine, together with the option of an energy spending massage, or a
  snorkeling tour, all will combine to bring your spirit and body in balance.
  Most rapidly you will have forgotten about the everyday stress that you might
  experience in your professional life.The day starts with a sun salutation, or
  a smooth awakening yoga practice, in the pleasant light of the first sunbeams,
  as the sun climbs over the horizon of a deep blue sea.</p>

 	YogaCruising is certainly one of the most exciting ways to travel around Southern Turkey.<br />Our yachts provide from 6 &ndash; 12 cabins with double beds or 2 single beds. Each cabin is equipped with WC, shower and air condition. These yachts are &ldquo;Gulets&rdquo; &amp; Phinisi". Traditionally crafted wooden sailing boats, of a length ranging from 25 to 50 meters, with 2 or 3 masts.<br />Each meal is freshly cooked on our YogaCruising tours and we serve a healthy, vegetarian, Mediterranean cuisine. Already the traditional Mediterranean Brunch breakfast and Dinner consists of a plethora of locally Organic produced. We always serve fresh fruit of the season as a dessert or as a snack for in between meals.<br />The Yoga sessions take place mostly on the sun deck, at some occasions on the beach.&nbsp; During the trips there is plenty of time to relax, to read or chat under a shady sail, with a quieting view over the sea. Twice daily (mornings and evenings) you can enjoy our modern yoga sessions, giving you physical exercise and deep relaxation.<br />A choice of excursions on land will give you plenty of opportunities to get to know the nature, the culture and the history of this region. Exquisite jaunts to historical, archeological sites, herb hiking tours, or a visit to a nomadic village or a traditional&nbsp;<strong>Turkish bath</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; a hammam. They all share enriching insights into the wealth of the eastern Mediterranean culture.
