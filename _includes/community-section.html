 	My Mission: to make yoga a mindfulness practice affordable and accessible to all! No paid subscriptions or membership dues, just you, your mat and a bottle of water! I do not ask for money, however I do accept donations that most likely will be donated to non-profit organizations. I'll try to make everyone comfortable and safe within their skill level and ability to do yoga. No one is required to do or to try any pose, and everyone is expected to practice safety and to stay within their own physical limits. The benefits from practicing yoga do not require competition or perfection. The benefits from practicing yoga come from maintaining and enhancing your body's ability to move, to stay flexible, and to experience the free flow of energy &amp; light within. Namaste
